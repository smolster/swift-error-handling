Mack -- thinking this doc can serve as a bank of generally unformed thoughts, while proposal.md would be a place where we'd add coherent thoughts intended for the final proposal

My thoughts on process: Perhaps we take the following approach:
1. Gather information on previous proposals, as well as current relevant ones
    - **Why**: We want to understand the context we are walking into, and ensure that we are operating with a holistic perspective

2. Determine goals for our proposal -- at the highest level, what change do we want to make for developers? (e.g. we want to provide a robust error handling solution)
    - **Why**: My thought is that this will help to focus and guide our solutioning.

3. Iteratively draft proposal, seeking continuous feedback from colleagues (and potentially non-colleague experts?)
   - **Why**: We want to ensure that by the time this gets in front of Swift folks, more people than just us have gotten their eyes on it. I think the earlier we start getting feedback here, the better?

4. Once we have a "good-enough" draft of the proposal, put it up on the Swift Evolution Forums
   - **Why**: Sticking to "good enough" will help ensure that we get the communities eyes on it sooner, which means it will be more likely to get into Swift, generally

Open to any and all thoughts you have about this process Mack
